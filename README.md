# Pleasant Pigeons

## About

Pleasant Pigeons adds pigeons to Minecraft. They will occasionally drop items, and different pigeons will drop different types of items.

### What Do They Do?

They're cute. They also scare spiders away, <s>but them being cute is enough anyway</s>.

Different types of pigeons will drop different items as their special item drop, and those are documented [here in the wiki](https://github.com/ThePoultryMan/Pigeons/wiki/Pigeon#special-drops). This gives the player the ability to create a farm for these items using pigeons.

### Taming and Breeding

The items needed to tame and breed the pigeons are documented [here](https://github.com/ThePoultryMan/Pigeons/wiki/Tags).

### Accessories
**Thanks tristankechlo**

You can craft different accesories to put on your pigeons. Equip your pigeons with an accessory by right clicking it, and unequip it by shift clicking. You can read more about the accesories [here](https://github.com/ThePoultryMan/Pigeons/wiki/Pigeon#accessories).
