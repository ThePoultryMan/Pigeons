# Pleasant Pigeons

## About

Pleasant Pigeons adds pigeons to Minecraft. They will occasionally drop items, and different pigeons will drop different types of items.

### What Do They Do?

They're cute. They also scare spiders away, <s>but them being cute is enough anyway</s>.

Different types of pigeons will drop different items as their special item drop, and those are documented [here in the wiki](https://github.com/ThePoultryMan/Pigeons/wiki/Pigeon#special-drops). This gives the player the ability to create a farm for these items using pigeons.

### Taming and Breeding

The items needed to tame and breed the pigeons are documented [here](https://github.com/ThePoultryMan/Pigeons/wiki/Tags).
